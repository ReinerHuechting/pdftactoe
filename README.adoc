= PDF Tac Toe

LaTeX and maybe other code that generates a pdf file with slides that
contain a game of Tic Tac Toe. The idea is to draw all reachable game
states on slides and put links to follow-up states in each cell.
This way, a player can play Tic Tac Toe by clicking in the pdf.

This is just a fun project and there is no reason to prefer this over
any other way of implementing tic tac toe. It is rather a way to play around
with LaTeX, Tikz, and with ways of generating LaTeX documents.
